This is my submission for the coding challenge.


There are several things which I did not implement because I believed they were extra stuff and this is simply a coding challenge, not creating a complete A-Z app.
I do believe I demonstrated my ability to properly configure and create a web app for this challenge.

Assumptions:
- assumed that all accounts registering have an unlimited number of users. I added the field in the database but don't use it.
- I kept just the initial editionCode and didnt create any others.
- As stated in the document AppDirect handles the subscription payments therefore I didnt implement more packages than the standard/monthly pricing.
- I did not entirely optimize the database schema simply due to time constraints, for example opting for data type TEXT rather than var char and flexibility
    instead of saving DB space knowing this isn't whats normally done.
- I wrote javadoc on some methods to show that I can do them, however I didnt do it on all the methods because its very time consuming and I am under time constraints to complete
    this.
